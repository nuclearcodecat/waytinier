 - the structure is a disgrace to programmers worldwide, do something with
   the god references. i could hold a `next_id` in a lighter god object
   which doesn't hold the idmap. the idmap could just be stored in `App`.
   i think this could work. draw this out on paper
 - i don't like the buffer match statement. a buffer trait would be better
 - i'm not sure if i should even focus on the dma heaps. i think i should
   just use gbm at this point. i could still finish them and add as an
   additional api
 - remove id() from WaylandObject
 - remove god() from WaylandObject if i get rid of god WeakCells entirely
